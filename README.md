# The Gesture LED Board

Yo ! This is a advaned version of LED Lamps , this is the gesture one , u can use gestures to contrtol it such as intensity , modes and colours coould be changed . This is specially designed to keep next to ur monitor on your desk ( As for me ) and i have still not thought to make any improvements . I got this idea a lot of months ago but not completed as i was out of station . 

The very first thing i did was to make a BOM for this , I kinda used ChatGPT for doing so , not completely but i used it to correct the item no. of the specific components i needed and also to provide me the lcsc codes ....

HERE ! This Was Finalised and generated as an image by ChatGPT .

The Very Next Sted I  Was To Do Was To Deal With My GitHub Repo Thing So I Am Currently doing that and will also updatye this in the BluePrint Journal Entry. 

After That I have decided to work on the schematic work for the PCB and then the routing and at last the 3D Printing Work . 

## Schematic Finished 

This was not tough for mr but a lot of timetaking as i am a veryyyy much beginner in these hardware things especially the 3D Designing and also my BRICK with i5 and igpu .
