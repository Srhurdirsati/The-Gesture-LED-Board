## 10/22/2025 3:13 PM - Planning Completed And Schematic Started !  

DATE = 22 OCTOBER 
TIME = 3:09 p.m

This ided struck me when i was seeking openai for some new project ideas for my setup which included my own PCB and Code along with My Custom 3D Printed case . This was a lil tough to find but a small chatgpt tweak made me do it easily.

First I started with this work when i was out of station with just my mobile device , no compouter i can really work upon , whuke travelling , i got an idea of plannin for my next project so i turned on my mobile and made a BOM first ( Roughly ) and then the GitHub Repo which couldn'e be saved so i recreated it again and my journey was completed while doing this . Starting the Schematic Work Now !
I used a lil bit of chatgpt and some tutorinals to gather the BOM and the image uploaded also is made from ChatGPT, Ill inform about Any changes in the next journal

## 10/22/2025 11 PM - Routed The PCB Completely 😒  

Yoo guys , routing the pcb will be my next part of my work in this project , this was a lil ldifficult as i was new to easyeda and these softwares so i didn't knew how to route this , i took help from ChatGPT for this and a lil from my brother and YT . This made me complete my routing part for the PCB work and now the PCB work is finished and I'll move on to 3D CAD modelling in the next part .

## 10/23/2025 11:00 PM - COMPLETED ALL THE CAD WORK AND THE CODE WORK . 😎  

Back Again !
Yesterday , i was done finishing the schematic work and finished it too along with the plannig done already . Now i took my notebook and made a rough sketch of what i was trying to built in 3d invluding the case and the final look , i started with the base part and went forwqard to make the top , the base part was a lil diff to make as i included some text which i didn't knew how to move and control so tooko some yt lessons and made it final in one go .

After doing this , i wanted to make the code for this to run too which was easy for me as i was kinda familiar with the code stuff but this time , it took a lil more time than expected due to my foolishness . MB :/ , but finally did it too . This was the most fun day of this project also most working.

## 10/23/2025 11:19 PM - GitHub Completed .   

The GitHub Work Is Completed too , i just needed to upload all the files that were ready inside my workspace folder , All the journals were automatically added in by the blueprint site and also i have fifished the readme work time to time so i think now i am fine and no improvements needed . .

## 11/5/2025 - Done All The Commented And Required Changes For This Project  

I was commented many times on this project to expand the journals which i just did [technical_.] and included all the PCB files in my repo [Kai Periera] along with the PCBA which can be made as pcb project too . This was my 2nd project in my lifetime so it was a bit confusing for me and also i'm new in HCB so I didn't knew much about it but now after this , i m quite familiar with the working and projects so i will take care for all the projects from now on and try to give my best 

As I did all the commented corrections and now I'm hoping just for a clean approval for this project . I started this a quite ago but summiting it a lil late .![JLC OF WAVU](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6ODU1MywicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--a5c98d0d7b9f5bb80de809111f5ca13b533c7664/JLC%20OF%20WAVU.PNG)
  

## 11/7/2025 - Made The Project As PCB From PCBA   

This change was recommended by one of the reviewers to make my project to use pcba to pcb , I thought that it will be the same price as i also had to play the pcsc charge for delivery fee but it made it a much cheaper now , from $66 to $42 , i think now this will be the final update of this project . ![LLCPCB](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6OTExMCwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--f3bc6b2156f03119edab3b13ce65123d045783cc/LLCPCB.PNG)
