## 10/22/2025 11 PM - Routed The PCB Completely ðŸ˜’  

Yoo ! So Far I've completely routed my PCB. This Was not tough at all but my pc took a lot of time to just move components . Also i am veryyy new so it took a lot more time . Next thing will be 3d designing and at last coding for my microcontroller. ![Routing.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDUwNiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--9a337cf87ef330e53bf78872d41b58e81a0af746/Routing.png)
  

## 10/23/2025 - COMPLETED ALL THE CAD WORK AND THE CODE WORK . ðŸ˜Ž  

Back Again !
The last day wasn't tough but I think today was , i started with designing the base part first which was a lil easy but adding and moving the text took me a lot of time as i was kinda new soo .... Also coding part was easy too. ![Capture 2.PNG](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDgzMSwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--308f2558fabe08cb4e1db079fadeb880656d81e6/Capture%202.PNG)
