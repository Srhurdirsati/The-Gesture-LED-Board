First I started with this work when i was out of station with just my mobile device , no compouter i can really work upon , whuke travelling , i got an idea of plannin for my next project so i turned on my mobile and made a BOM first ( Roughly ) and then the GitHub Repo which couldn'e be saved so i recreated it again and my journey was completed while doing this .

## 10/22/2025 11 PM - Routed The PCB Completely 😒  

Yoo ! So Far I've completely routed my PCB. This Was not tough at all but my pc took a lot of time to just move components . Also i am veryyy new so it took a lot more time . Next thing will be 3d designing and at last coding for my microcontroller. ![Routing.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6NDUwNiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--9a337cf87ef330e53bf78872d41b58e81a0af746/Routing.png)
  

## 10/23/2025 11:00 PM - COMPLETED ALL THE CAD WORK AND THE CODE WORK . 😎  

Back Again !
Yesterday , i was done finishing the schematic work and finished it too along with the plannig done already . Now i took my notebook and made a rough sketch of what i was trying to built in 3d invluding the case and the final look , i started with the base part and went forwqard to make the top , the base part was a lil diff to make as i included some text which i didn't knew how to move and control so tooko some yt lessons and made it final in one go
